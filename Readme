#3) To Do List [tricky]

-build a todo list with html, css, (scss) and vanilla js (style nicely, best practices)
-Page Header 'ToDo List'
-input (add) toDos)
-button(submit todo)
-render your todos with a title and a delete button
-completed todos section. This should include some conditional rendering(if there are no todos, render a message[ie 'no completed todos'])

-adding to dos-> Delete Todos -> Complete Todos
-Completing a todo item will remove it from the todo list, but will add it to the completed list.
-clicking a completed todo sould remove it from copleted but add it back to the open todos.

\*\* Keep UX in mind (user experience) IE. submitting a todo item will clear the input.

Bonus: Persist the todo list in the borwser (cookies, localstorage)
